The first subject I am starting with is `Compilers`. I started reading "The Art
of Unix Programming" a couple of weeks ago, and am really enjoying it. Along 
with it I also started tinkering with vim, and got interested in LSP, LSC &
editors. On further research I discovered that to dive deeper into the subject,
and understand these components better, I would require to learn more about 
compilers, & it's components. And hence, Compilers I shall study.
